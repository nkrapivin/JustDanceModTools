# JustDanceModTools

Pretty much what it says.

IpkTool - a tool to unpack, pack, create patches for and patch ipk files.

KtapeTool - a tool to uncook .ktape.ckd files into something more readable and vice-versa into weird null-terminated JSON.

Only tested to work on the latest update of the european Just Dance 2020 for the Nintendo Switch.

"The source is the documentation" as for now, if you need help poke me @ Discord (you know where to find me).

Have fun*!*
